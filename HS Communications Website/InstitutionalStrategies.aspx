                    <h2>INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIES</h2>
                    <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formation is essentially connected with people who are responsible with the process. In line with this, the Colegio focuses its strategies on the three basic areas namely: witnessing, service and human resource.</p> <br />
             
                                    <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality results require quality strategies. Strategies should be the best the Colegio can offer. These strategies are: </p> <br />
                   <br/> 
                
                
                
                <br/>
                    <h3> Quality Witnessing </h3>
                   <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colegio’s primary mission is formation of students. Effective formation requires quality witnessing from formators. In the Colegio, these formators are the faculty members, the non-teaching staff and the administrators. The formators themselves should be able to portray what the Colegio wants its students to be. 

 </p>
                <br/> <br/>
                
                <h3>   Quality Services</h3> 
                   <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services are the activities that the employees do to facilitate the attainment of the Colegio’s institutional objectives. The Colegio offers three basic services, namely: managerial, teaching and support services. Teaching is at the center of these services. Managerial services provide direction, system and procedures and management among others. Support services provide assistance to both. 

                       </p>
                <br/>
                 <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colegio puts premium on quality in all the services it provides. It demands quality from its administrators, teachers and non-teaching staff. </p>
                 <br/> <br/>
                   <h3>  Quality Resources</h3> 
                   <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Quality witnessing and quality services will be greatly enhanced by quality human resource. Quality human resource focuses on the development and is solidly anchored on spiritual development. 
                       </p><br/>
                  <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The Colegio also desires the continuous improvement of its employees’ professional knowledge and skills. 
                   </p><br/>
                  <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The Colegio continuously looks for means and ways to improve the salaries and benefits of its employees.

                   </p>
                 <br/> <br/>
                   <h3>    Quality Facilities</h3> 
                   <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As the Colegio continuously improves its human resource, it also improves its facilities. Quality facilities help the human resource performs his tasks better.

                 <br/> <br/>
                   <h3>  Quality Systems Policies And Procedures</h3> 
                   <p class="leftt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Colegio strives to upgrade its policies to provide more stability on its operations and its procedures to have a more effective and efficient system.
